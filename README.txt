This folder contains: 
-  "README.txt" - this file
- "ass1_fullcode.py" - (the code in which I answered the tasks described in assignment 1)
- "SpotifyFeatures.csv" - the dataset I have been working with in the code


"ass1_fullcode.py" is a model which filters out nessecary data from "SpotifyFeatures.csv",
and performs logistic regression on the dataset, with stochastic gradient descent. 
Its performance can be read about in the report "assignment1_Kjersti_Farstad.pdf",
which is uploaded into the delivery folder on canvas.
